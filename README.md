# high-on-life-fov
This is an FOV locker for the game High on Life as it is really annoying for me to go into Cheat Engine, scan and replace the bytes. This tool will do that for you.
Once you have it downloaded, you will just be able to open UUU to change the FOV and then run the exe file. This will lock your FOV in game.
















## Huge credits to The Guy on Steam for figuring this out. Check out his thread at: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1583230/discussions/0/3717189457453925172/











This works on build 10125262 of High on Life!! Download the binary for your game version from the downloads section or compile yourself. 



This only works on Windows as I use functions from Windows.h, ect.
